  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer shows polygons of average annual precipitation in the 
      contiguous United States, for the climatological period 1961-1990.  
      Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) 
      derived raster data is the underlying data set from which the polygons 
      and vectors were created.  PRISM is an analytical model that uses point 
      data and a digital elevation model (DEM) to generate gridded estimates 
      of annual, monthly and event-based climatic parameters.  
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the Spatial Climate Analysis 
      Service, the USDA - NRCS National Water and Climate Center, the USDA - 
      NRCS National Cartography and Geospatial Center, or the U.S. Geological 
      Survey in the use of these data.

    Supplemental_Information:
      There are many methods of interpolating precipitation from monitoring
      stations to grid points.  Some provide estimates of acceptable accuracy 
      in flat terrain, but few have been able to adequately explain the 
      extreme, complex variations in precipitation that occur in mountainous 


      regions.  Significant progress in this area has been achieved through 
      the development of PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on
      Independent Slopes Model).  PRISM is an analytical model that uses 
      point data and a digital elevation model (DEM) to generate gridded 
      estimates of monthly and annual precipitation (as well as other 
      climatic parameters).  PRISM is well suited to regions with
      mountainous terrain, because it incorporates a conceptual framework 
      that addresses the spatial scale and pattern of precipitation in such 
      regions.

      Detailed descriptions of the PRISM raster data can be found on the 
      Oregon State University PRISM web page at 
      <http://www.ocs.oregonstate.edu/prism/>.

      NRCS offers the source PRISM data packaged on 3 CD-ROM's covering the 
      Lower 48 United States.  The CD-ROM’s are available as a set for $150.00.  
      The 48 States are broken into three regions: East, Central and West.  Each 
      CD contains the annual and monthly precipitation coverages, as well as the 
      gridded data.  The CD-ROM's may be ordered through

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Point estimates of precipitation from the U.S. National 1961-1990 Climate
      Normals were subjected to manual quality control checks by the National 
      Climatic Data Center (NCDC).  PRISM precipitation estimates were reviewed 
      by the PRISM Evaluation Group, a panel of climatologists, meteorologists, 
      and hydrologists.  The task of this group was to assess the assumptions 
      made by the model and compare model output with the best available 
      precipitation maps from several western States.  The group found that the 
      PRISM maps equaled or exceeded the accuracy of the best maps available.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Precipitation data were derived from two main sources, NCDC Climate Normals 
    and NRCS Cooperative Snow Survey Data (SNOTEL).  In general, NCDC stations 
    are located at low elevations and in valley bottoms, and encompass the 
    entire United States.  SNOTEL stations are located primarily at high
    elevations in the western United States.

    Polygon and chain-node topology are present.  Checks were made to ensure
    that no two adjacent polygons are labeled with the same precipitation 
    value.  A manual spot check was made of peaks, depressions, and islands.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes observations and interpolated values for the 48 
    contiguous United States and the District of Columbia, for the
    climatological period 1961-1990.  This data set is a compilation of the 
    best available data from the various data sources.
